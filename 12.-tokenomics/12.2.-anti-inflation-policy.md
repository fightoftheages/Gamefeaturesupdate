# 12.2. Anti-inflation Policy

Inflation has become a serious problem for virtual economies when the number of Tokens put into circulation exceeds the demand of the whole market. This increase in tokens causes their value to decline, which, in turn, makes users feel that their assets decrease over time. FOTA realizes that this is an issue that needs to be considered and resolved from the moment the project is conceived. Therefore, FOTA decides to issue only one Token to manage the circulation of money easily as well as to ensure low inflation through the metrics shown on the Blockchain network. In addition, FOTA also developed a Treasury to allow a portion of the profits of the entire FOTA to be used for the buyback and burn mechanism, thereby minimizing the risk of increased Token supply or illiquidity on the entire system.

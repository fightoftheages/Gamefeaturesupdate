Each Hero NFT has 2 indicators, Ownprice & Total Profit&#x20;

#### Ownprice:&#x20;

Ownprice is the total cost of minting 1 NFT when users purchase directly from FOTA Development Team on FOTA Marketplace. Upgrading Heroes' Skills with Aether will increases Ownprice.&#x20;

Each Hero NFT has 2 Ownprice values:&#x20;

* USDF Ownprice is the fixed price of Heroes officially launched at level 1 and will increase after each time leveling up the skills with Aether. Consuming 1 Aether adds 5 USDF to the USDF Ownprice (1 Aether = 5 USDF)&#x20;
* FOTA Ownprice is determined according to the time users purchasing their level 1 Heroes:&#x20;
* For NFTs minted before July 5th, 2022; FOTA Ownprice is USDF Ownprice /0.17&#x20;
* For NFTs minted after July 5th, 2022, FOTA Ownprice is USDF Ownprice divided by the highest price within 12 hours when the NFTs are minted.&#x20;

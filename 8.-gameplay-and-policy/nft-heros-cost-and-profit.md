**OwnPrice** of 1 NFT Hero will increase after a successful hero skill upgrade.

**Profitability:**

Profit of 1 NFT Hero is calculated when:

* Hero participates in PVE missions&#x20;
* A player wins the mission&#x20;
* FinishGame transaction successfully called on Smart Contract

Mission Reward, after deducting other fees, will be divided into 3 and added to the profit index (**TotalProfit**) of 3 heroes participating in the match.

An NFT hero is said to be maxed profit when the total profit achieved = 300% of **OwnPrice**.

A Hero NFT when reaching maxed profit cannot be brought into the squad to fight missions.

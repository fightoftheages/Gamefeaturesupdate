# Energy

**Energy** is the energy used to play PVE missions (Worldmap Campaign)

At 0:00 UTC every day, the player is granted a certain amount of **Energy** to use for that day.

Total **Energy** in 1 day is calculated according to the formula: **Total Energy** = Total level of heroes x 3, in which:

* The total Hero level is only counted from the heroes in the wallet and the rented hero that has not been revoked.
* Excluding heroes posted for sale/rent on the marketplace.
* Excluding heroes who have reached maxed profit.

**Note**: Any shifts in the heroâ€™s level of the day do not affect the total EN of that day.

# üèû 6. The Worlds Saga

During The Worlds Saga, players will officially enter a new era of MOBA game series, where each player will control a hero to follow an allied team to explore 7 new planets and many new lands on a World Map, which expands across the universe. The technical platform will allow millions of players to conquer real-time missions on a world map of the entire universe. The Worlds Saga only allows players who achieve the minimum Rankings in The Unity Saga to enter conquests.

Also, in The Worlds Saga, FOTA will open the Cross-NFT feature, thereby allowing users to bring NFT assets, such as Hero and Items, to other gaming platforms owned by DJINN. Those NFT assets will be optimized to be used in multiple GameFi projects.

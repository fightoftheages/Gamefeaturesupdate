# 5.3. Duel (Challenge)

In the Duel mode, players can create rooms in 1v1 mode where each user controls 3 to 5 heroes, and 2v2 to 5v5 mode, where each user controls 1 hero.

The 2v2 to 5v5 modes allow groups with a minimum of 2 people and a maximum of 5 people to create rooms to hold group battles. Unlike Campaign and Arena, the Duel mode requires groups to place a bet that is decided between the parties. The bet will belong to the victorious team and be divided equally among the members.

In Duel, the Auto-matching Algorithm is also applied to find players with similar parameters. However, clans can directly challenge other clans as they wish, if they feel qualified or want to try.

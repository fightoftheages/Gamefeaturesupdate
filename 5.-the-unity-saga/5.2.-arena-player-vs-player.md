# 5.2. Arena (Player vs Player)

For the Arena mode, players can organize their own match at any time based on FOTA's automatic matching algorithm. Normally, the system will automatically analyze the stats of the players on the platform and sort the players with similar parameters in real-time. This is necessary because in Arena mode, the winner will get experience points that allow leveling up and get more tokens as rewards so they can buy more items or convert to fiat. At this time, the Auto-matching Algorithm will show the ability to match fairly to avoid weak players being matched with opponents with overwhelming strength on the parameters.

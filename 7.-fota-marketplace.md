# ðŸ“¦ 7. FOTA Marketplace

The FOTA Marketplace is a decentralized exchange platform that allows players to directly trade and rent NFTs with each other, including directly training skills for heroes and items from the Common level to higher levels. NFTs that users can trade on the FOTA Marketplace include the System of Hundreds of Heroes that are updated every week, Fotaland, Skins, and 70 items at The Unity Saga.

In addition, the FOTA Marketplace will open the NFT rental feature for Heroes, Items, and Skins. For players who are new to the game and have a need to use Heroes or Items with a high level but do not want to spend too much time or money on upgrading the above NFT components, Rent-to-play is a remarkable feature. Rent-to-play allows players who already have Heroes and Items of high levels to rent out those NFT properties on the FOTA Marketplace. This feature helps to solve the problem between players who want to optimize NFTs such as Heroes and Items that are available, as well as players who do not have enough experience or money to buy high-end items. The establishment of a lease contract will be established through a Smart Contract between lessees and lessors, thereby avoiding the occurrence of violations of loan terms on the Binance Smart Chain.

For each transaction, 10% of the transaction fee will be used to:

* 3% for the Developers&#x20;
* 2% for Referral
* 5% for the Treasury &#x20;

The Treasury will be used as an anti-inflation fund for the FOTA Marketplace. Besides, the Treasury will be used to buy back and burn the first NFTs listed for sale every quarter. For the amount in the Treasury that is not used up, these tokens will be burned at the end of each quarter.

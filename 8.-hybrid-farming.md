About the Aether, in particular, from the very beginning of the FOTA universe, the Aether is seen as the origin of all cosmic energy. Currently, the Greenland is considered the center of the Aether before it was scattered everywhere in the universe. Some creatures can make use of this energy, allowing them to cast spells. The Omnis have the ability to open Time-Space Bridge thanks to their gifted Aether manipulation. Moreover, Aether is also used to make tools with great destructive abilities. It is because of this great power that many races are seeking to gather as much as possible for themselves, causing an imbalance in the entire universe.

# ⚙️ 10. Microsoft Mesh (Metaverse)

FOTA integrates the Microsoft Mesh technology, a Platform built by Microsoft Corporation to explore and experience the Metaverse in the best way. Microsoft Mesh is the world's first Platform that fully supports MR technology.

MR (Mixed reality), also known as hybrid reality, is a world mixed between reality and virtual world in which real and virtual objects both exist and interact in real-time. MR is a combination of VR and AR technologies. In MR, the things of the real world and the virtual world will interact with each other. In short, this technology holds real-world information in the virtual world, creating a world that mixes both reality and fantasy. Mixed reality technology is similar to AR. But not monotonous with graphics or text on the real background, this technology focuses on systems, links to create an environment full of facilities such as SKYPE phone calls or Microsoft Hololens to connect all multimedia content and entertainment.

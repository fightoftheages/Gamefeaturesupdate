# 4.2. Items

FOTA strongly supports NFT assets to motivate players to own their valuable items and assets. Immediately upon launch, FOTA allows users to use 70 diverse types of NFTs divided into four main groups, including Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. For items in the Common category, players can directly buy them at the project's official Store on FOTA Marketplace. The remaining item categories require the player to use the alchemy ability to forge equipment in the Rare category or higher.

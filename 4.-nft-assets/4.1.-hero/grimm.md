# GRIMM

## Abstract&#x20;

Grimm, like Cyril and Ciara, was a demon lord of the Nightmare. Grimm, on the other hand, was more cruel than brutal. He did not slaughter his prey as other Demons. Instead, he would torture them until hearing them scream in agony and watching them flutter, all he wanted was to see others suffering the pain. He crazily loved the pain, for him the pain was like a beautiful symphony and he was the artist finding the rhythms of his life. For that reason, he left Greenland and reached the Nightmare - a world filled with sorrow, where he could easily enjoy the pain he desired. Living a peaceful life on the Greenland was not for a cold-blooded artist like him.&#x20;

## Story

Despite being an Omni god, Grimm was extremely attracted to the death and pain of others. He always took the name of the Omni, seeking the battlefield where Human tribes were competing in order to secretly provoke wars. At the outbreak of war between the Omni and the Demon, Grimm was more excited than ever. He'd seen a lot of horrible things on the Earth among Humans, but this was the first time he'd been treated with a scene of After the war, he left the boring Greenland and got to the Nightmare - a world filled with death and sorrow, where he could easily enjoy the pain he desired. Grimm knew that the aim of the Demon was to destroy all to stand master of the universe. But if this war ended, there would be no pain left, what would he live for when it’s all over? Obviously, Grimm did not want this at all so he did all things to prevent both sides from gaining the ground in the battle.among Gods.

Obviously, Grimm did not want this at all so he did all things to prevent both sides from gaining the ground in the battle.

By bluff and guile, Grimm easily became the custodian of the Hell Gate. By knowing how to harness the power of the Darkness, his power suddenly rocketed compared to that when he was on Greenland. With that power in hand, he defeated countless fierce enemies and threatened anyone who stood in his way. Moreover, he took his seat and stood astride both worlds, the Omni and the Demon. The Omnis wanted to eliminate the Darkness while the Demons ruled it to unlock and boost the dark power within them. That was a perfect balance to Grimm.

But Grimm soon realized that there would be no more drama unless someone pulled the strings. After that, Grimm started his own plan to let the anguish, the pain and the wish for death take over this universe. So he found ways to contact Malhela - a great mage serving under Silver. He came there and revealed to Malhela all those secrets of life and how the Omni deceived the Human. Grimm wanted the Human to worship the Demon and use dark power from the Darkness instead of Aether. And last, he revealed the secret of opening a Space Bridge where all definitions were distorted. A Space Bridge would be a tunnel for the Beast to get in and help Silver unite the world, but in return, Mahela had to help Grimm with one thing. Till now, no one knew exactly what really happened between them two, but the doomsday Dark Moon was coming. The whole universe was sunk into the abyss of a new dark age, being in pain and being in fear. That was exactly what Grimm always pursued. But was it true that this was his dream or was it just a drama made by an artist playing his deadly symphonies?

During the era of The Unity Saga, FOTA allows players to conquer 30 lands on 3 different worlds: the Greenland, the Earth, and the Nightmare. Each land will become a unique NFT asset. When players can create their own Clan, they will be entitled to hold one corresponding NFT Land and receive 1% of the profits from that land. In addition, NFT Landowners are allowed to sell or rent that land with members of their own Clan.

### üî∂ 3.1.1. The Omni

The Omni is one of the unique races of the FOTA universe. They have an elegant form with the ability to master the use of ‚ÄúAether‚Äù energy in the form of magic. This is also a race created from the earliest times, along with the land of Greenland.

Throughout its formation and development, the Omni has taken advantage of the potential power of ‚ÄúAether‚Äù to serve their struggles for peace and open Space Bridge to explore new lands to make the FOTA universe even more powerful.

At the height of their civilization, the ancient Omnis had reached the realm of mastery with an incredible amount of knowledge, as well as a level of cutting-edge technology that brought them to the ultimate dominion of the universe. However, because of the temptation of power, some righteous Omnis realized this potential danger and decided to distribute the power to the descendants to maintain the balance of ‚ÄúAether‚Äù.

Through a long struggle to find and develop the universe, the number of Omnis in Greenland has gradually decreased. In some worlds, the Omnis are seen as gods with powerful magical abilities.

### üî∂ 3.1.2. The Dragon

The Dragons are mystical creatures of the Greenland, described with a massive body and large wings that allow them to soar through the sky of Greenland. In recorded history, Dragons are inaccessible aerial beasts and tended to attack the Omni when they appeared. However, the ancient Omnis, with their strong leadership, realized the potential of this mighty race when they witnessed the Dragons using the power inherited from "Aether '' to allow acceleration in flight while unleashing elemental attacks onto enemies. Since then, the Omnis have tried to reach out and show that The Dragon is not a threat to The Omni and they are allies, the Omni will stand by the Dragon to protect the promised land - the Greenland.

Throughout Greenland's development history, the Dragons stand side-by-side with the Omnis, they have been strengthened with the fast-paced energy as well as the mighty power from "Aether", sometimes, The Dragons also join with the Omnis in space exploration.

### üî∂ 3.1.3. The Elf&#x20;

The Elf is a race with a strong but flexible body, living in the civilized world of the Earth. They have a society based on the protection of nature here, they receive the favour of the Mother Nature, allowing them to use the "Aether" energy as their power to fight against the enemy or protect themselves. The Elf worships the Omni as gods with great power. In the past, upon reaching the Earth, the Elf was the first race that the Omni approached. Realizing the race's strong memory capacity, the Omnis decided to impart a wealth of knowledge about the universe and observe the Elf take advantage of it to develop civilization here.

However, due to the meager concentration of "Aether" energy on the Earth's surface, the Elf could not reach their full potential.

### üî∂ 3.1.4. The Keen&#x20;

### 3.1.4. The Keen

The Keen is created from the energy of "Aether" and minerals of the Earth. The Keens' bodies are surrounded by the most durable metals, giving them an indestructible body. However, their survival depends on the transformative power of the "Aether." If they fail in maintaining energy for themselves, the Keen will have to receive a tragic end to become inanimate blocks of metal. Therefore, the Keen lives in the most extreme lands, with abundant energy sources, such as majestic volcanoes or rivers that continuously emit heat. Existing in these habitats, it seems, the Keen rarely encounter other races on The Earth.

The Keen also understands that the life source in their bodies will sooner or later become a sought-after energy resource. So, based on the transformation ability received from the Omni, they have equipped themselves with the most advanced weapons built from primitive materials to protect the Aether energy source that fuels their souls. Since then, the Keen has become the most battle-hardened race on Earth.

### üî∂ 3.1.5. The Human&#x20;

The Human is the most populous race on Earth. Physically, they are not as strong as the Elf, nor do they possess an indestructible body like the Keen. However, in return, they are a race with high social behavior through solidarity and quick-wit intelligence.

In the early days of the Earth, the Human often had conflicts with the Elf and The Keen in order to expand their domain as the population of their race sharply increased. During these skirmishes, they realized that they were not a nemesis of the Elf and the Keen, one possessing special combat skills and the other equipped with advanced weapons. Thus, thanks to the wisdom enlightened by the Omni, coupled with their agility, The Human has made partial exchanges of their wit to obtain well-protected cosmic knowledge and unique minerals by the Elf, at the same time, using those obtained materials opened up to trade with the Keen for additional sources of advanced weapons and hidden technological mysteries, to develop the ultimate ‚ÄúAether‚Äù capabilities for the Human race.

Despite starting as a weak race, the Human has gradually taken over most of the lands across the Earth and always yearns to one day access the source of the ‚ÄúAether‚Äù power.

### üî∂ 3.1.6. The Demon&#x20;

The Demon is a race that craves the incomparable power of ‚ÄúAether‚Äù in the cold world of the Nightmare. The Demons are rumored to be corrupted ancient Omnis.

Legend has it that, in the process of exploring the universe, some Omnis, through Space Bridge, reached the coldest and most distant land, where the pure ‚ÄúAether‚Äù energy was depleted. Instead, dark magic took its place. The ancient Omnis tried to transform or use this new energy for their travels, but something unexpected happened. The strange power was uncontrollable and infiltrated the body then possessed the mind, turning the great Omnis into evil beings - the Demons.

A great war broke out between the Omni and the Demon. But with the help of the Dragons, the Omnis succeeded in driving the corrupted Demon race out of the sacred land of Greenland and exiled them to a cold place far away, in the fringe of the universe, called The Nightmare. Perhaps, that part of history is a stain on the noble Omni race itself, so there is no record of this story. As for the Demon race, they continue to use the dark energy to dominate the creatures in the land of Nightmare and harbor the intention of possessing the power of ‚ÄúAether.‚Äù

### üî∂ 3.1.7. The Beast&#x20;

The Beast is indigenous to The Nightmare.They are a fierce race with extraordinary endurance and also the first inhabitants of this terrible land. To survive in the harsh environment, the Beasts are nourished by the dark energy that surrounds this place, so they tend to strengthen their body parts to use as weapons and attack all creatures that step into their territory. It is also because of this warlike nature that this race has deplorable social behavior. Also, due to this uncontrollable ferocity, the Demon was forced to give up their intention to recruit the Beasts into their army to conquer Greenland.

### üî∂ 3.1.8. The Ogre&#x20;

The Ogre is a monster race bred by the dark magic of the Demon. With the ambition of possessing Aether to conquer all lands, the Demon wishes to establish a powerful and elite army. At the time, the Beast was chosen as the target of taming to serve this diabolical scheme. However, the Demon was defeated by the brutality of this wild race. Not stopping there, during their visits to the Earth, the Demon saw a monstrous combination that created a new species with the power inherited from the Beast and the thinking ability from the Human. Since then, the Ogre was born to serve the revenge plan of the Demon.

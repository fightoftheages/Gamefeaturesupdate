# 3.2. Classes

### 🔹 3.2.1. Mage

The Mage is a Class that specializes in destructive skills with magic taking from the “Aether.” In skirmishes, they can proficiently deal medium, long-range damage and also have the ability to manipulate a crowd to carry out their attack intentions.. However, the Mage is often believed to be weaker due to their limited casting time when it comes to melee combat. Therefore, when facing Classes that favor physical strength and melee, the Mage seems to have no chance winning.

### 🔹 3.2.2. Priest

The Priest is a Class of the "Aether" cult. They believe that Heroes should only use this power to maintain balance and help weak creatures. Therefore, Priests often enhance their ability to develop healing and protection skills through the knowledge gained from the "Aether" energy. In battles, Priest often stands at the back to help recover and reduce damage suffered by allies. Although the Priest's ability to deal damage is relatively low, their resonance skills always make them become the target of Classes using dark power.

### 🔹 3.2.3. Warlock

The Warlock is a particular class that can both use pure and dark energy obtained from “Aether.” Therefore, with unique skills, the attacks of the Warlock often deal a significant amount of damage. However, despite having excellent attacking abilities, their HP is their biggest weakness. So, in combat, a Warlock needs to have constant protection from other classes to avoid being attacked and focus on showing off their core abilities.

### 🔹 3.2.4. Warrior

The Warrior is a class of elite warriors who are trained to use weapons skillfully. Their power is more physical than magical. They use magic only to strengthen their body, increase protection, and increase damage to physical attacks. Warriors are very suitable for melee positions. If equipped with weapons transformed by the energy of “Aether,” they will become a bane for magical classes.

### 🔹 3.2.5. Chemist

The Chemist develops its abilities at making potions through learning from the darker corners of the "Aether" knowledge. Though not possessing serious physical damage or the ability to channel magic, the Chemist's poison-imbued equipment is the kind of magic that disables and damages opponents persistently throughout the game. In a fight, a Chemist is well-suited in support positions to restore health for the attack line with lightning speed or use toxins to debuff opponents during the match.

### 🔹 3.2.6. Hunter

The Hunter is also known as the survivalist. Carrying sharp bows and arrows or destructive rifles, they roam around the jungle in search of prey. Not only can they kill any creature encountered, but the Hunter also can attract animals to become companions. Because of their deep connection with nature, they are an essential part of the game for maintaining the balance of the life-and-death cycle of nature.

### 🔹 3.2.7. Assassin

The Assassin is known as the dauntless killer. They can use physical skills combined with unique magic to increase damage. However, the Assassin's defense is lackluster, only allowing them to mainly fight in areas with rugged terrain, suitable for hiding and taking advantage of their lightning reflexes.

### 🔹 3.2.8. Mech

The Mech is the true heir of the Keen. They combine the technology which their race has learned and the energy of "Aether" to create advanced weapons of destruction to attack opponents at breakneck speed. However, their shortcoming lies in the “Aether’s limited storage capacity”. Thus, in a fight, if their team has a Priest or Mage support, a Mech will avoid wasting energy and deploy skills most effectively.
